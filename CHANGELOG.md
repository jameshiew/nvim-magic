## Unreleased

## [0.2.3] - 2021-09-18

### Added
* Predefined `<Plug>` commands to make mapping custom key sequences to flows easier

## [0.2.2] - 2021-09-16

### Changed
* Vim notifications display buffer filename if possible
* Use [lustache](https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/lustache) for filling out prompt templates

## [0.2.1] - 2021-09-14

### Changed
* Disable requesting compressed HTTP responses on Windows as possibly it is less likely to be supported by Windows' `curl`s

### Fixed
* Send an appropriate Vim notification in more cases when `curl` terminates with nonzero exit code, rather than raising a plenary.path error
* Prevent logspam when OpenAI returns a non-200 HTTP status that was caused by a timer not being closed properly

## [0.2.0] - 2021-09-14

### Changed
* Use Vim notifications for info messages instead of echoing them
* Vendor forked curl code from [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) so that upstream plenary.nvim can be required as a dependency without issue
* No longer freeze up Neovim while completions are being fetched ([#1](https://github.com/jameshiew/nvim-magic/issues/1))

### Fixed
* Using a default keymap in a buffer should work first time rather than just deselecting the current visual selection ([#2](https://github.com/jameshiew/nvim-magic/issues/2))
* OpenAI API key should no longer leak in an error message when `curl` times out, rather a generic request timed out error message is shown
